    "description": "Hello, I am posting here to know from more expert people which one can be better. Since in the EU chat control is going under the radar, with nobody caring about it, I am starting to look for methods I can use in the near future. I know about Open PGP and OMEMO, I also found an adroid app on F-droid called Conversations, which uses OMEMO and OpenKeychain. Now, I would like to know for more expert people what would you choose and suggest to your parents and family members that barely can use a PC? Open PGP is quite complex for a person that can just turn on the PC and do stuff on the internet, you need to copy, paste to decrypt. OMEMO with Conversations is more similar to an actual messaging app, so very good for people used to them. In your opinion, which is the best one? I don't know if there are open source apps that help avoiding the copy/paste step in Open PGP. Any suggestion is appreciated :) submitted by /u/yamete_kudastahp [link] [comments]",

Now, we have a complete chain from ransomware gang research, through to TTPs, into CVEs, enriching those CVE's from CISA KEV and NVD data, and then through to example sigma rules for common datasets. I'm keeping it all publicly available for free in my repo , or you can browse it all on the site: https://incidentbuddy.ai/gapmatrix . The data enrichment process runs nightly, so as soon as NIST update their dataset, my data gets updated. Also, I've built the MITRE ATT&CK Threat Heatmap , which uses the same security advisories to show which Techniques are most likely to be used. Obviously you can click through all of this to dig in to the underlying TTPs etc. Anyway, I hope you find it useful! submitted by /u/RichBenf [link] [comments]",

    "description": "Been reading about supply chain attacks and it seems like typosquatting (fake packages with similar names) is still a thing. But I'm curious how often do these actually succeed? From what I can tell, most attacks happen during install-time through lifecycle hooks (postinstall scripts, setup.py execution). Static scanners like Snyk catch some of this, but they miss obfuscated code pretty often. I built a tool to test this and scanned ~15k malicious npm packages. Found that 89% of them have detectable patterns even with basic regex + AST analysis. Makes me think most attackers aren't even trying that hard to hide.

The last 48 hours have been wild and I wanted to pull everything together because the individual headlines don't capture how bad this actually is. The numbers as of today: SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team published their scan results. When the report first went live, they'd found about 40,000 OpenClaw instances exposed to the public internet. By the time The Register wrote it up a few hours later, it had tripled to 135,000+. Their live dashboard (declawed.io) is updating every 15 minutes and the count keeps climbing. Of the instances they've analyzed: 63% of observed deployments are vulnerable 15,000+ are exploitable via remote code execution right now 53,000+ correlate with prior breach activity Three high-severity CVEs, all with public exploit code available Users are leaking API keys, OAuth tokens, and service credentials through their exposed control panels The root cause is almost embarrassing. OpenClaw binds to 0.0.0.0:18789 by default. That means it listens on ALL network interfaces, including the public internet. For a tool that has shell access, filesystem read/write, credential stores, and control of your messaging apps, the default should obviously be localhost only. It's not. The CVEs are brutal: CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8): One-click RCE. Visit a malicious link, attacker steals your auth token and gets full control of your agent.",

The \"manager\" of compliance is completely brand new to this too and as we're going through the controls there's no notes being taken or understanding as they keep deferring to either myself, or the previous person who put some rules on CUI in place but by no means was the compliance manager. This manager is very green and you can tell is not detail oriented in the ways that are required for this audit. Their manager doesn't even attend our calls, and when they do there's no contribution or ownership of compliance/regulation. It's feeling like they believe ownership of this is going to fall on me, IT but my understanding has always been IT puts in place systems, logs, etc etc and compliance owns the understanding of those implementations.

I didn't watch it because I haven't unpacked my TV yet. Instead, I spent the evening arguing with my stepbrother about DNS, VPNs, and trust on the internet. He runs AdGuard on his phone to block ads. His favorite feature is that it fixes up websites so there aren't any ugly grey spots on the website where an ad WOULD be. That freaked me out because that told me that the app can rewrite the DOM in his browser. He informed me that its all good because he hasn't given the permission to iOS to allow Adguard to mange his DNS. And yet! the ads were being overwritten. Curious! So I ripped down the adguard iOS app's code from github. It hasn't had any commits in 4 months, which I found weird for an app with millions of users. Digging in a bit further, I learned that the library that adjudicates DNS is actually closed source. I did a tiny bit of lightning triage on the compiled binary itself but nothing suspicious leapt out at me. Because of the nature of the app store, I don't even KNOW that the code on github is the same as the code compiled into the iphone app. While reversing the app and reviewing the code I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load. The javascript is pulled remotely every 6 hours.",

Data Handling: We receive files via secure links from the Navy and handle them strictly locally on our machines. No cloud storage for CUI yet. Internal Tools: We build our tools internally; our dev environment doesn't touch the client data. The Quote: We reached out to a compliance automation startup (not mentioning names) and got quoted: Level 1: $60k Level 2: $150k Total: $210k As a startup, this is a massive chunk of our runway. Are the above estimates accurate? We obviously dont have alot of man power to dedicate entirely for this so we want a solution that involves as little effort from us? The above company mentioned that a big chunk of the above fee is for the C3PAO. I am open to suggestion of companies that have been tried and reliable (via DMs?)

    "description": "Hi all - I\u2019m fairly new to CMMC, so apologies in advance if this is a basic question. I\u2019m trying to understand what \u201ccontrolling the flow of CUI\u201d should look like in practice within an organization. Our current setup is roughly this: - We have an on-prem file server that hosts a VHD encrypted with BitLocker. - This VHD is intended to store CUI. - Access to the location is restricted to a dedicated security AD group (only authorized personnel are members). - Users can access and work with the data, but in practice they often need to download/copy files from the VHD to their local workstations or laptops to actually do their jobs. This is where my concern comes in: once the CUI is on a user\u2019s local machine, there\u2019s very little technically preventing them from sending it to other employees who are not authorized, or even sending it outside the organization (e.g., via email, cloud storage, etc.). We do have: - Policies that prohibit improper sharing of CUI - Mandatory training on handling CUI - NDAs that employees must sign, and disciplinary consequences if they violate these rules However, there are currently limited technical controls to actually prevent exfiltration once the data leaves the file server. My question: Is relying primarily on policies, training, and disciplinary measures considered sufficient to \u201ccontrol the flow of CUI\u201d under CMMC level 2? Or would auditors typically expect stronger technical safeguards (e.g., DLP, endpoint controls, email controls, VDI, etc.)?",
