      <description>The company I work for sells hardware and software solutions to various branches of the Fed government. Are there any published guidelines by the DoD on how to evaluate telemetry/call-home data we collect (for technical support purposes) for the presence of CUI? submitted by /u/psenevir [link] [comments]</description>

      <title>Level 1 &amp; 2 data residency</title>

      <description>The organization I work for currently utilizes many Cloud/SaaS applications to operate their business. Some of the SaaS service providers can guarantee our CUI &amp; FCI stored on their infrastructure will remain on US soil (i.e. Microsoft), but some cannot. As a steward for helping protect Fed data I feel there needs to be some guidance published on this topic from DoD. What do you think?

Those cards use SSH 1.1 for encryption making them out of compliance with NIST 2.0, and there is not a replacement/upgrade option.
