      <description>It's a lot like the CMMC GRC tools you might be considering but limited, at the moment, to building your System Security Plan (SSP), only this one is free and Open Source. Feel free to create issues for fixes or recommendations for more functionality. This is not a link to my business nor is it intended to self promote in anyway (added for the mods to consider). submitted by /u/Leguy42 [link] [comments]</description>

      <title>OMEMO/Open PGP</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r1qxd0/omemoopen_pgp/</link>
      <description>Hello, I am posting here to know from more expert people which one can be better. Since in the EU chat control is going under the radar, with nobody caring about it, I am starting to look for methods I can use in the near future. I know about Open PGP and OMEMO, I also found an adroid app on F-droid called Conversations, which uses OMEMO and OpenKeychain. Now, I would like to know for more expert people what would you choose and suggest to your parents and family members that barely can use a PC? Open PGP is quite complex for a person that can just turn on the PC and do stuff on the internet, you need to copy, paste to decrypt. OMEMO with Conversations is more similar to an actual messaging app, so very good for people used to them. In your opinion, which is the best one?</description>

      <description>Working across endpoint, firewall, DLP, email security, and VAPT over the years, AI keeps coming up in almost every industry discussion. Trying to separate practical impact from positioning. For those working hands-on: Where is AI genuinely improving detection or response workflows today?

      <title>Ransomware Gang Data - Now Doubly Enriched</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r1s4oc/ransomware_gang_data_now_doubly_enriched/</link>
      <description>Hi all, I seem to have properly gone down a rabbit-hole with the whole &quot;let's build the biggest ransomware gang TTP database on the net&quot; thing. Now, we have a complete chain from ransomware gang research, through to TTPs, into CVEs, enriching those CVE's from CISA KEV and NVD data, and then through to example sigma rules for common datasets. I'm keeping it all publicly available for free in my repo , or you can browse it all on the site: https://incidentbuddy.ai/gapmatrix . The data enrichment process runs nightly, so as soon as NIST update their dataset, my data gets updated. Also, I've built the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Threat Heatmap , which uses the same security advisories to show which Techniques are most likely to be used.</description>

      <title>Security analysts, what's your biggest time sink outside actual security work?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r1cctp/security_analysts_whats_your_biggest_time_sink/</link>
      <description>Curious what everyone's biggest non-technical time drain is. For me it's reporting. We're talking 40% of my week pulling data from different tools, making graphs, explaining the same metrics to different stakeholders over and over. I'm good at finding threats but starting to feel like a glorified data analyst. My manager says this is normal but half the time these reports sit unread anyway.

      <title>What's the actual risk of typosquatting attacks in 2026?</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r1iuew/whats_the_actual_risk_of_typosquatting_attacks_in/</link>
      <description>Been reading about supply chain attacks and it seems like typosquatting (fake packages with similar names) is still a thing. But I'm curious how often do these actually succeed? From what I can tell, most attacks happen during install-time through lifecycle hooks (postinstall scripts, setup.py execution). Static scanners like Snyk catch some of this, but they miss obfuscated code pretty often. I built a tool to test this and scanned ~15k malicious npm packages. Found that 89% of them have detectable patterns even with basic regex + AST analysis. Makes me think most attackers aren't even trying that hard to hide.</description>

      <title>135,000+ OpenClaw instances exposed to the internet, 63% vulnerable, and the fix they just announced isn't going to cut it</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r16yb4/135000_openclaw_instances_exposed_to_the_internet/</link>
      <description>I run a skill scanning platform in the AI agent space so I've been following the OpenClaw situation closely. The last 48 hours have been wild and I wanted to pull everything together because the individual headlines don't capture how bad this actually is. The numbers as of today: SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team published their scan results. When the report first went live, they'd found about 40,000 OpenClaw instances exposed to the public internet. By the time The Register wrote it up a few hours later, it had tripled to 135,000+. Their live dashboard (declawed.io) is updating every 15 minutes and the count keeps climbing.</description>

By the time The Register wrote it up a few hours later, it had tripled to 135,000+. Their live dashboard (declawed.io) is updating every 15 minutes and the count keeps climbing. Of the instances they've analyzed: 63% of observed deployments are vulnerable 15,000+ are exploitable via remote code execution right now 53,000+ correlate with prior breach activity Three high-severity CVEs, all with public exploit code available Users are leaking API keys, OAuth tokens, and service credentials through their exposed control panels The root cause is almost embarrassing. OpenClaw binds to 0.0.0.0:18789 by default. That means it listens on ALL network interfaces, including the public internet. For a tool that has shell access, filesystem read/write, credential stores, and control of your messaging apps, the default should obviously be localhost only. It's not. The CVEs are brutal: CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8): One-click RCE. Visit a malicious link, attacker steals your auth token and gets full control of your agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cybersecurity&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r16yb4/135000_openclaw_instances_exposed_to_the_internet/&quot;&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>I work at a small subcontractor and we are prepping for c3pao assessment this year. I am the IT person at the business and haven't particularly been through CMMC compliance but have worked in various security niched businesses. I'd love to hear some suggestions and feedback regarding my situation. The &quot;manager&quot; of compliance is completely brand new to this too and as we're going through the controls there's no notes being taken or understanding as they keep deferring to either myself, or the previous person who put some rules on CUI in place but by no means was the compliance manager. This manager is very green and you can tell is not detail oriented in the ways that are required for this audit.</description>

Their manager doesn't even attend our calls, and when they do there's no contribution or ownership of compliance/regulation. It's feeling like they believe ownership of this is going to fall on me, IT but my understanding has always been IT puts in place systems, logs, etc etc and compliance owns the understanding of those implementations. Am I just changing my mindset on this one?

      <description>Text for those that dont want to go to LinkedIn and see Andrew's post: gm linkedin! Hope everyone enjoyed the superbowl! It's just about as american as it gets. I didn't watch it because I haven't unpacked my TV yet. Instead, I spent the evening arguing with my stepbrother about DNS, VPNs, and trust on the internet. He runs AdGuard on his phone to block ads. His favorite feature is that it fixes up websites so there aren't any ugly grey spots on the website where an ad WOULD be. That freaked me out because that told me that the app can rewrite the DOM in his browser. He informed me that its all good because he hasn't given the permission to iOS to allow Adguard to mange his DNS. And yet! the ads were being overwritten. Curious! So I ripped down the adguard iOS app's code from github.</description>

So I ripped down the adguard iOS app's code from github. It hasn't had any commits in 4 months, which I found weird for an app with millions of users. Digging in a bit further, I learned that the library that adjudicates DNS is actually closed source. I did a tiny bit of lightning triage on the compiled binary itself but nothing suspicious leapt out at me. Because of the nature of the app store, I don't even KNOW that the code on github is the same as the code compiled into the iphone app. While reversing the app and reviewing the code I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load. The javascript is pulled remotely every 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cybersecurity&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1r0q6oq/andrew_morris_finds_ios_adguard_is_written_by/&quot;&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>CMMC Level 1 + 2 - Small startup - price</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1r0jmsx/cmmc_level_1_2_small_startup_price/</link>
      <description>We are a small startup (handful of devs) currently working with the Navy/DOD. Our contracts are now requiring CMMC Level 1 and Level 2. Everything we develop is for internal use by our engineering team (the one that interfaces with client data). Team: Only 3 people actually interface with the client/sensitive files. Data Handling: We receive files via secure links from the Navy and handle them strictly locally on our machines. No cloud storage for CUI yet. Internal Tools: We build our tools internally; our dev environment doesn't touch the client data. The Quote: We reached out to a compliance automation startup (not mentioning names) and got quoted: Level 1: $60k Level 2: $150k Total: $210k As a startup, this is a massive chunk of our runway. Are the above estimates accurate?</description>

Are the above estimates accurate? We obviously dont have alot of man power to dedicate entirely for this so we want a solution that involves as little effort from us? The above company mentioned that a big chunk of the above fee is for the C3PAO. I am open to suggestion of companies that have been tried and reliable (via DMs?)
