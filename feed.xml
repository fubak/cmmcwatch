      <description>We’ve completed a NIST SP 800-171 self-assessment and, up until now, have typically only been asked to provide an SPRS score.

Curious if others are seeing this more often, or if it’s still more situational.

      <content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're attempting to tackle WSL in our compliance journey. We're a small group of people doing a large variety of work. We have lots of weird engineering, software development, and electronics apps running. All of which are a huge pita to lock down for CMMC purposes. As for WSL - on one hand it's an application but it's behaves more like a VM. I don't see any reasonable way to get technical controls running inside the WSL guest environment but it seems unreasonable to allow it to run whatever sof&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source: Cmmc Reddit Cmmc&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1qauimv/wsl_windows_subsystem_for_linux/&quot;&gt;Read full story →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Questions on CM.L2-3.4.1 Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/CMMC/comments/1qb1jmj/questions_on_cml2341_establish_and_maintain/</link>
      <description>We are using AWS Gov Cloud enclave with outsourced MSSP CrowdStrike for Gov Cloud and this control is fully met by Falcon Complete. Anyone have any examples on how you provided evidence for the objectives? Do you point to the CS Baseline CRM? Did you break down your inventory to CUI Assets, SPA, etc? Thanks! submitted by /u/CJM3M [link] [comments]</description>

      <title>Looking for technical collaborators: Stress-testing Hybrid DAG / PQC architecture against FIPS 140-3 and CNSA 2.0 (NIST 800-171 context)</title>

      <title>NIST standards regarding outside plant hardware/software</title>
      <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/1q7ilw7/nist_standards_regarding_outside_plant/</link>
      <description>Hello, We are a small Telco/Broadband company in rural Arkansas. We have 122 cards in our subscriber network rings that handle copper connectivity. Those cards use SSH 1.1 for encryption making them out of compliance with NIST 2.0, and there is not a replacement/upgrade option. How would you all handle that in regard to your documentation in case of an audit by the FCC? I am new to Cybersecurity and want as much input as I can get. Thank you in advance!, ~John [GuitarStu] submitted by /u/GuitarS</description>
